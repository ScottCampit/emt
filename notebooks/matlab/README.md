# MATLAB Notebooks
The MATLAB notebooks detail the steps to perform constraint-based modeling, construct metabolic flux and knockout profiles, and additional analyses.

## Description
The following is a general description of each subdirectory.
### 01_bulk_analysis
Perform metabolic flux and knockout analysis for bulk datasets. We analyzed the data using the RECON1 and iHUMAN metabolic reconstructions.

### 02_single_cell_analysis:
Perform metabolic flux and knockout analysis for the Cook & Vanderhyden single-cell RNASeq datasets. We analyzed the data using RECON1 and iHUMAN metabolic reconstructions.

### 03_parameter_sensitivity
Simulated metabolic fluxes and knockout growth rates by varying kappa and rho. 

### 04_post_processing
Generate metabolic flux and knockout profiles.

### 05_accessory_functions
Additional functions that helped with mapping data and other necessary tasks for downstream analyses.

### 06_old
Old files that may or may not be relevant for current analyses.
