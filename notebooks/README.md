# Notebooks 
Our analysis utilized 3 programming languages. 
  * Python was used to perform MAGIC data imputation
  * R was used to perform CRISPR-Cas9 analysis and other omics data visualization tasks
  * MATLAB was used to perform constraint-based modeling

In addition to physical assets, Google Colab notebooks were used to perform additional analyses. Those can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kCNsrULvzgaTEH3387mAx7KbB_dJSO4p?usp=sharing).
