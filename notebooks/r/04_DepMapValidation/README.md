# DepMap Analysis

## TODO:
  * Make notebooks more readable

## Summary
This directory contains DepMap-related analyses used to validate and benchmark COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) predictions. We analyzed the following omics data:
  * CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality scores
  * siRNA essentiality data
  * Drug sensitivity data

## Usage
For this analysis, run the notebooks in the following order. A short description of each notebook is also provided.
  1. depmap_preprocessing.Rmd: Data preprocessing for each dataset
  2. crispr_validation.Rmd: CRISPR-Cas9 validation
  3. siRNA_validation.Rmd: siRNA validation
  4. drug_validation.Rmd: Drug validation

## Data availability
Data can be loaded through the FigShare portal and the Zenodo data portal.
